        For a long time, I’ve thought about writing a book on translation. What interests me is the possibility of accounting for the lived experience of translators—those silent agents of literary history. I’m equally intrigued by the complex relationship between writers and translators. And while there are many theories of translation, very little has been written about the everyday psychology of translating.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        The possibilities for both real and imaginary relations between trans- lator and author are endless: they may become lovers, enemies, rivals, or traitors to each other’s cause. When everyone gets along, when translator and author negotiate smoothly, when the editor serves as a guarantor of rights on both sides, translation can be an extremely satisfying undertaking for both author and translator, in which each feels fulfilled and grateful to the other. But when something goes wrong, a translation conflict can be exceedingly complex and difficult to resolve.
    </p>

    <p>
        The kind of conflict I am alluding to is often merely a hypothetical drama on our minds as we, the translators, go about our workaday busi- ness. The dilemma takes place within ourselves, and we resolve it by the time the work of translation is finished. But what happens when the con- flict is not merely theoretical, a working principle, but breaks out into an actual fight between two or more of the parties involved? I enjoyed an article I read several years ago by an excellent translator called “The Only Good Author Is a Dead Author,” explaining the headaches she had working with a difficult and demanding author. And I’ve recently heard about the troubles of a translator whose author—a Japanese essayist of great renown—insisted on continually revising his work. Just as the translator would finish a draft of an essay, the author would send an entirely new version of the text, demanding a retranslation. The translator was Sisyphus, except that the boulder changed shape each time he had to lug it up the hill.

        There are many stories of prominent writers who insist on challeng- ing the translations of their work into languages they barely know. Writ- ers want to control language—this is their job—and they’re only too ready to believe that their talent for words extends across all linguistic boundaries. Vladimir Nabokov was famous for his vigilance concerning every word of his translations—and when this polyglot spotted an error, he could be unreasonable. His wife Véra, as vigilant as he, pored over the Swedish translations of his <i>Pnin</i> with the help of a dictionary and determined that entire passages were missing, and that the anticommunist slant of the original had been muted. She ordered the entire Swedish stock of both <i>Pnin</i> and <i>Lolita</i> destroyed. In July 1959, the Nabokovs’ lawyer served as witness to an enormous book burning on the outskirts of Stockholm<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>. It’s a rare event in literary history when a writer burns his own books.

        The problems that translators have with living authors are well known, and we can understand what it means to want to work on a writer whose life’s work is complete, and who is no longer around to pass judgment on a translation. Fortunately, there are many dead authors who have yet to be translated. And unfortunately, the opposite can never be true: a dead author can have a living translator, but no living author can ever work with a dead translator. Some would like to!

    <h2>A Translation Fiasco</h2>

    <p>
        The following story about a very living translator is a rather personal one, and, in retrospect, it’s amusing to recount. But it is also instructive, and I believe it can shed light on the problems I’ve outlined above.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ll call my translator, in the interests of privacy, “Mr. X.” Mr. X was hired by a French publisher to translate my book, <i>French Lessons</i>, an auto-biographical essay about an American who falls in love with the French language. As in all such stories, the path of my love for French was not always a smooth one. Nor, as it turned out, was the path of translation. I should preface this story by explaining that Mr. X had an excellent reputation as a translator of social science—history in particular—and that he was an exacting, detail-oriented translator who was used to working closely with his authors. Translation was his only source of income, and he had an ongoing relationship with a powerful editor at this particular publishing house; this editor had imposed him on the more junior editor who had acquired my book.
    </p>

    <p>
        There was an implicit difficulty in translating my book into French which any translator would have to have faced. In the original English, it presented the French language as an object of desire, a coveted and foreign language world that resisted being conquered. The French language, you might say, is a character in the book—or, to use another metaphor, the book’s landscape. French words and sounds occur within the text, in their otherness. About a first trip, to boarding school in Switzerland, the young adolescent narrator writes:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        The driver came in a Mercedes van. He looked like a soccer player. He said to me in French: “Don’t try to speak to me in English because I don’t understand.” He was testing me. He said, “Where are your bags?” The word came up from my throat. “Là-bas,” I said, pointing. (45)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        or
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        The French have a verb for the kind of work I did at the Swiss school: bosser, which comes from a word meaning “hunched” and means hunkering down to work, bending down over some precious matter and observing it. (56)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The translator who would have to render this otherness in French itself—where the French words would no longer stand out from the rest of the words in the book—was facing a challenge. It wasn’t clear that the “mirror” would work: i.e., would French readers be interested in the ex- perience of an American learning their language? Or was the book only readable to an American reader who could identify with the difficulties of an American trying to learn a foreign language? There are ways to handle this—putting words in quotation marks or all caps to make them stand out from the text, using phonetic or at least nonstandard spelling to indicate an American accent in French, or perhaps even adding some American words to the French text to represent the two language worlds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mr. X’s first response to the book was wild enthusiasm. He was excited to be doing his first literary translation. He fantasized an enormous com- mercial success for my book, and media stardom for me—thanks to him— complete with an appearance on Bernard Pivot’s literary talk show, with his expert coaching to prepare me. From these ambitious and enthusias- tic beginnings, things went quickly downhill. In order for my book to achieve this status, Mr. X was convinced it needed serious adaptation. It would not work, as it was, for a French public. He therefore set out to rewrite it, according to his idea of the image a French reader would want to have of an American learning French.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the time I felt at a disadvantage: I had an immediate instinct that this was the wrong approach, but I did not have the scholarly ammuni- tion to bolster my argument against my determined translator. I had not read much of the theoretical literature on translation. I needed a theorist to explain X’s attitude, and to give me grounds on which to oppose him. I laterfoundthistheoristinAntoineBerman,author of <i>L’épreuvedel’étranger</i>, and <i>La traduction et la lettre ou l’auberge du lointain.</i><sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup> He had a view of the relationship between author and translator that was respectful and nuanced and that felt right to me. Berman writes:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        J’appelle mauvaise traduction la traduction qui, généralement sous couvert de transmissibilité, opère une négation systématique de l’étrangeté de l’oeuvre étrangère.
        <br> I call bad translation any translation which, using the pretext of transmissibility/communication, works towards a systematic negation of the foreignness of the foreign work.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Even though I don’t always agree with Berman when it comes to his evaluation of specific translations—I think his defense of foreignness is exaggerated and often untenable—I relish this argument that makes Mr. X into the epitome of the ethically bad translator.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Not only was X an ethnocentric translator, he was an egocentric trans- lator: the combination of nationalism and a certain psychology were fatal. “If I don’t change the text as I’m translating it, I feel castrated,” he ex- plained. A sensitive fellow! Change the text he did. . . . He changed the order of sentences in a paragraph if he felt my construction wasn’t French enough. He cut sentences he didn’t agree with. He especially resented a sentence in the beginning of my book—which explained the minimalist style in which the book was written:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        My mother still corrects my English grammar, in speech and in writing: “to whom,” not “to who”; “effective,” not “affective,” “he did well,” but not “he is good.” She corrects the number of times I use “very.” She is against waste in language. Her sentences are short and blunt, yet ripe with innuendo and the promise that more is being said than meets the ear. Now I write in the staccato midwestern style she taught me. (7)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        This “argument de style” he complained, was going to hamper his style. . . . He hadn’t spent all those years at the rue d’Ulm honing an extremely sophisticated prose style, nourished by the best that had been written in French, from Chateaubriand to Proust, only to be forced to write like a monosyllabic halfwit. Yet my book actually talked about its own style: I, the author, was committed to straightforward, simple writing. I intended that my language sound more like an elemen- tary French lesson than Mémoires d’outre tombe. . . . If Mr. X disobeyed the metacommentary on style within my book, his own prose would be wrong. This annoyed him greatly.
    </p>

    <p>
        For all his resistance to my foreignness, Mr. X would occasionally surprise me with a plunge into American consciousness. There were two characters in French Lessons, my brother and sister, whom I did not men- tion by name. This was in part to protect their privacy, in part to give the early childhood section of the book the feeling of a fairy tale or myth, one step removed from documentary or history. My translator—obviously not a reader of Marguerite Duras!—explained to me that it was very ugly in French to refer to any characters as “il” and “elle”—indeed, this wasn’t possible. Therefore he proposed to give them names, averting what he considered an embarrassing French mistake. He chose the names “Betsy” and “Joey” for my siblings. Why? He explained that his favorite American television show was Friends (on cable TV), and he wanted to use names from that show. There is a character named Joey on Friends, but no Betsy, as far as I know. Perhaps he was thinking of Betsy Ross, who sewed the first American flag—a figure every American schoolchild learns about. The ways of Mr. X were mysterious, but this, in any case, was his bow to representing American culture in my very American text.
